### A Simple Game Engine
This is a simple game engine written in C++,which includes two modules:Core and Engine.

Core Module encapsulates graphics and mathematical algorithms,provides external logic writting interface.

Engine Module provides the logic interface of game.

## Core 
Core Module provides following functions:

Matrix and Vector Operations.

Rendering pipline and algorithms.

Coordinate transformation and model movement and rotation algorithm.

Model constructing and Visual Plane cutting.

## Engine
Engine Module provides following functions:

Camera

Graphic Interface

IO Interface

Model

Object

Game Window management

Scene management

### Engine Usage
This Game engine is compatible .org modeil file

We can create simple 3D game by calling the interface function in engine.
